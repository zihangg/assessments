# Getting Started

Make sure the backend is enabled prior to starting the application. Read the readme for the backend to set up the backend accordingly.

Without changing anything, the backend should resolve to localhost:8080, if any changes are made. Please changet the .env file to correctly reflect the new backend url.

Once the backend is enabled, install the packages with

### `npm install`

<br />

Then run the application:

### `npm start`
